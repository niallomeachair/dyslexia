<h3>Audio books</h3>
<p>I found using audio books and podcasts to be invaluable in helping me to develop my understanding of what dyslexia is and how it was a power for good when properly understood.
  Many people with dyslexia who get to adulthood without knowing their disability have become more in tune with other areas in life. This is a development as a result of coping mechanisms to work around feeling or looking silly and begins at an early age.

            <h3>Check yourself</h3>
<p>If you suspect you might have dyslexia, consider the following signs and symptoms that are commonly associated with dyslexia in adults:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Difficulty reading, including slow reading speed and frequent misreading of words.</li>
  <li>Problems with spelling, including frequent spelling errors and difficulty remembering how to spell common words.</li>
  <li>Challenges with writing, such as difficulty organizing thoughts on paper and  frequent grammar mistakes.</li>
  <li>Difficulty with time management and organization, including trouble keeping track of appointments and deadlines.</li>     
  <li>Problems with memory, including difficulty remembering names, dates, and other important information.</li>
  <li>Difficulty following multi-step instructions or directions.</li>
  <li>Struggles with learning new languages or accents.</li>
  <li>Difficulty with math, including trouble with basic arithmetic and understanding mathematical concepts.</li>
  <li>Problems with concentration and focus, including being easily distracted.</li>
  <li>Difficulty with sequencing tasks or events in the correct order.</li>
  <li>Challenges with social interactions, including difficulty interpreting social cues and understanding sarcasm or humor.</li>
  <li>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious in situations that require reading or writing.</li>
  <li>Low self-esteem or feelings of frustration related to academic or work performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you identify with several of these signs, it may be beneficial to seek a professional assessment from a psychologist or educational specialist who can provide a formal diagnosis and recommend appropriate support and accommodations.</strong></p>
