       <h3>Primary school</h3>
<p>All my school life I had teachers tell me I was lazy. I have a vivid memory of being laughed at when mocked by a teacher for spelling bird as d.i.r.b. Even now, thirty years later some of my primary school peers remember how I stood at the back of the classroom on a daily basis. They don’t remember the torture of trying to learn poetry or quotes for hours without any success. Other silly little things have followed me throughout my life. Analog clocks and watches look nice but the hands will have moved on when I figure out what was displayed when I started looking at them. I struggled all my life with left and right… I still do.</p>

<h3>Secondary school</h3>
<p>In my Leaving Cert year I was "excused from attending" one class for not learning the material. I know there was a law called Avogadro’s law in Chemistry…..no idea what it was about and still am none the wiser. So after being dropped from one class I had six subjects left to count in the Leaving Certificate exams. I finished up with one fail and scraping out with five subjects (the D3 in English maybe another missed nod to dyslexia) and just about enough points to get into college, not one I wanted but college nevertheless.</p>

<h3>College</h3>
<p>In 1999 I dropped out of a computer programming course. I immensly enjoyed learning C++ together with the Excel and Access database parts of the course. Horrific at the text heavy, communications and accountancy sections. These sections I was blocked from passing because all my efforts failed me and so I failed. I was devastated</p>

<p>In 2000 I dropped out of another college course for similar reasons where rote learning was necessary and remembering things based on learned text. Revising things that had been quickly forgotten the first time were quickly forgotten again. Often by the time I had finished reading a page. Lasting memory from this was my poor mother asking how I got 14% in an exam. It is difficult to explain the frustration at the time, knowing you've worked like others did but knowing also they could succeed but you could not but with no answer as to why.</p>

<h3>Working Difficulties</h3>
<p>In the workplace I sometimes struggled with reading poorly written or overly complicated emails, writing reports, filling in forms and structure of tasks. I felt embarrassed asking for help on things I should have known and so I regularly didn't seek help when I should have. I often felt stupid and incompetent compared to some of my peers but would never let it show.</p>

<h3>Recognising an undiagnosed adult with dyslexia</h3>
<p>Not knowing you are dyslexic or not understanding how dyslexia affects people shaped how I failed to see it in myself until my forties. My wife retrained to become a primary school teacher in 2015. It was she who realised I may have been struggling needlessly. While upskilling in topics relating to special education, she came across a list of possible indicators of dyslexia in primary school aged children and decided to ask me the questions. <strong>Bingo !!!</strong> Things she noticed me having difficulty with prompted her to pitch the qualifying questions at me.</p>
<h3>Moving forward armed with knowledge</h3>
<p>It appears to be a thing that many adults did not know they were dyslexic because they could read and write in school without difficulty. As it became something for me to look into before an official diagnosis, I found the issues were vast but not specific to an ability to read. Knowing many of my failures were not my fault through my stupidity, my laziness or malice on my part has been a tremendously healing experience. Jump forward two years from my wife's intregueing questions to April 2025. I was assessed and found to be quite dyslexic in specific areas. I also now know how to manage these challenges effectively, thanks to various techniques and technology.</p>
